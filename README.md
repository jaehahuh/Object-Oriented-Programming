# Object-Oriented-Programming

Program language : C++

These are homework and projects that I did in NYU Tandon object oriented programming class. What I learned in class is as follows.
- Pointers
- dynamic memory allocation and recursion
- constructors, destructors, methods and data members
- Access and the interface to relationships of classes including composition, association and inheritance. 
- Polymorphism through function overloading operators
